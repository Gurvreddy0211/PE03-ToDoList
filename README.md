Input: We will add the ToDoList.js file in the src folder and update App.js and App.css to get the ToDo List React application up and running. This way, it will be effective in managing tasks and will make sure to record only the necessary ones. This ensures that only relevant tasks are added in the list.

Process: Every task is controlled by React's useState hook, and it will always be kept updated. The application keeps the tasks in an array and dynamically renders them with the.map() function. React state management ensures adding/removing tasks updates the UI efficiently.

Output: The to-do list dynamically updates itself through adding and removing tasks. Each task appears in a structured list, styled by CSS to be more user-friendly. When the user clicks the "Delete" button next to a task, it instantly disappears from the list, giving immediate feedback.
